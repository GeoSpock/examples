# GeoSpock Integration: Jupyter

Integration example using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org).

##Running Jupyter

To run the sample Jupyter Notebooks, install Jupyter using these instructions: [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install.html). Alternatively, to 
quickly get started with simple Jupyter Notebooks, run `pip install notebook` and then `jupyter notebook` from 
your command prompt.

This opens the Jupyter Notebook browser page, where you can browse the following notebooks:

 - `Connections.ipynb` to see three methods of connecting Jupyter to your Presto cluster
 - `Case Study.ipynb` to run through some simple analysis using some publicly available data, including:
    - Kepler maps
    - Simple matplotlib graphs
